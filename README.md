Fork of the [source code examples](source) from the book [Functional JavaScript](http://www.functionaljavascript.com).

We're adding [literate coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) [variants](coffee) of examples as we work through the text.

* [Introducing Functional CoffeeScript](coffee/1.coffee.md)
* [First-Class Functions and Applicative Programming](coffee/2.coffee.md)
* [Variable Scope and Closures](coffee/3.coffee.md)
* [Higher Order Functions](coffee/4.coffee.md)
* [Function Building Functions](coffee/5.coffee.md)
* Recursion
* Purity, Immutability, and Policies for Change
* Flow-Based Programming
* Programming Without Class


## Reference

* [errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920028857)

* [js arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) - MDN quick ref for native javascript array objects

* [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - handy doc site

* [underscore-contrib](http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore-contrib/) -
  various underscore extensions.  The library currently contains a number 
  of related capabilities, aggregated into the following files:
  * `array.builders` - to build arrays
  * `array.selectors` - to take things from arrays
  * `collections.walk` - to walk and transform nested JavaScript objects
  * `function.arity` - to manipulate and fix function argument arity
  * `function.combinators` - to combine to make new functions
  * `function.iterators` - to lazily produce, manipulate and consume sequence iterators
  * `function.predicates` - that return true or false based on some criteria
  * `object.builders` - to build JavaScript objects
  * `object.selectors` - to pick things from JavaScript objects
  * `util.existential` - functions that check for the existence or truthiness of JavaScript data types
  * `util.operators` - functions that wrap common (or missing) JavaScript operators
  * `util.strings` - to work with strings
  * `util.trampolines` - to facilitate calling functions recursively without blowing the stack
