## Dynamic Scoping

Dynamic scoping is built on the idea of a global table of named values.

    globals = {}

Maintaining a global map of stacks associated with binding names is the core of
dynamic scoping.

    makeBindFunc = (resolver) ->
      (k, v) ->
        stack = globals[k] || []
        globals[k] = resolver(stack, v)
        globals

Now let's add a few policies for adding bindings to our global table.

The function `bind` performs a very simple task: it takes a key and
a value and pushes the value onto the global bindings map at the slot
associated with the key:

    bind = makeBindFunc (stack, v) ->
      stack.push(v)
      stack

The `unbind` function is the antithesis of `bind` in that it pops the
last value binding off of the stack associated with a name:

    unbind = makeBindFunc (stack) ->
      stack.pop()
      stack

Finally, we’ll need a function to look up bound values:

    lookup = (k) ->
      _.last globals[k]

    bind 'a', 1
    bind 'b', 1000

The `lookup` function provides a convenient way to look up the value at
the top of a named value binding stack, and is used to simulate this reference
resolution. Note the effects that various operations have on the simulated
dynamic scope:

    ok lookup('a') is 1
    ok lookup('b') is 1000
    ok lookup('c') is undefined
    eq globals,
      a: [1]
      b: [1000]

In a dynamic scoping scheme, the value at the top of a stack in a binding is
the current value:

    bind 'a', '*'

    ok lookup('a') is '*'
    eq globals,
      a: [1, '*']
      b: [1000]

To retrieve the previous binding is as simple as unbinding by popping the
stack:

    unbind 'a'

    ok lookup('a') is 1
    eq globals,
      a: [1]
      b: [1000]

You may already imagine (or know) how a scheme like this (i.e., the
manipulation of global named stacks) may cause trouble, but if not observe the
following:

    f = -> lookup 'a'

    ok f('a') is 1

    g = -> 
      bind 'a', 2
      f()

    ok g('a') is 2 
    ok f('a') is 2

    eq globals,
      a: [1, 2]
      b: [1000]

Here we see that though `f` never manipulated the binding of `a`, the value
that it saw was subject to the whim of its caller `g`! This is the poison of dynamic scoping: the value of any given binding cannot be known until the caller of any given function is known — which may be too late.

## Javascript's Dynamic Scope

The `this` (or `@`) reference can point to different values depending on the
context in which it was first created, but it’s actually much worse than that.
Instead, the value of `@`, like our binding of `a`, is also determined by
the caller:

    f = -> @

    nums = [1, 2, 3]
    eq f.call(nums), nums
    eq f.apply(nums, []), nums

Yep, the value of the this reference is directly manipulable through the use of
`apply` or `call`. That is, whatever object is passed into them as the first argument becomes the referenced object.

Underscore's `bind` function allows you to prevent the `@` reference from
changing:

    letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']

    bound = _.bind f, letters

    eq bound.call(nums), letters

You can use the `bindAll` function to lock `@` to a stable value
for all of the named methods:

    target =
      a: 'yes!'
      b: -> @a
      c: -> @b()

    throws -> target.c.call('no!')    # throws an error

    _.bindAll target, 'b', 'c'

    ok target.c.call('no!') is 'yes!'


## Closures

A closure is a function that captures the external bindings (i.e., not its own
arguments) contained in the scope in which it was defined for later use (even
after that scope has completed).

Local variables are not the only things that can be captured.  Function arguments can be captured as well: 

    shoutTo = (name) ->
      (say) -> "#{say} #{name}!"

    shoutToJoe = shoutTo 'Joe'

    ok shoutToJoe('Hi') is 'Hi Joe!'
    ok shoutToJoe('Bye') is 'Bye Joe!'

Another example:

    scaleBy = (factor) ->
      (nums) ->
        n * factor for n in nums    # nums.map (n) -> n * factor

    scaleByTen = scaleBy 10

    eq scaleByTen([1, 2, 3]), [10, 20, 30]

Note how the variable `factor` is retained within the body of the returned scaling function and is accessible anytime that function is called. This variable retention is precisely the definition of a closure.

    ###
    function createWeirdScaleFunction(FACTOR) {
      return function(v) {
        this['FACTOR'] = FACTOR;
        var captures = this;

        return _.map(v, _.bind(function(n) {
          return (n * this['FACTOR']);
        }, captures));
      };
    }

    var scale10 = createWeirdScaleFunction(10);

    scale10.call({}, [5,6,7]);
    //=> [50, 60, 70];

    function makeAdder(CAPTURED) {
      return function(free) {
        return free + CAPTURED;
      };
    }

    var add10 = makeAdder(10);

    add10(32);
    //=> 42

    function averageDamp(FUN) {
      return function(n) {
        return average([n, FUN(n)]);
      }
    }

    var averageSq = averageDamp(function(n) { return n * n });
    averageSq(10);
    //=> 55

    function complement(PRED) {
      return function() {
        return !PRED.apply(null, _.toArray(arguments));
      };
    }

    function isEven(n) { return (n%2) === 0 }

    var isOdd = complement(isEven);

    isOdd(2);
    //=> false

    isOdd(413);
    //=> true

    function plucker(FIELD) {
      return function(obj) {
        return (obj && obj[FIELD]);
      };
    }

    var best = {title: "Infinite Jest", author: "DFW"};

    var getTitle = plucker('title');

    getTitle(best);
    //=> "Infinite Jest"

    var books = [{title: "Chthon"}, {stars: 5}, {title: "Botchan"}];

    var third = plucker(2);

    third(books);
    //=> {title: "Botchan"}
